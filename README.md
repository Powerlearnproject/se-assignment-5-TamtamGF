Workspace Context:

The terminal opens with the context of the current workspace, automatically setting the working directory to your project’s root. This reduces the need to navigate to your project directory manually.
Synchronization:

The integrated terminal automatically synchronizes with the editor. For example, you can open files in the editor by clicking on paths in the terminal output.
Accessibility:

Accessing the terminal within VS Code is quick and easy using shortcuts or the menu, making it convenient to run commands on the fly.
Customization and Configuration:

The integrated terminal can be customized to use different shells, fonts, and colors, providing a consistent look and feel with the rest of your development environment.
Task Integration:

The integrated terminal works well with VS Code's tasks feature, allowing you to run predefined tasks like building or testing your project directly from the editor.
Extension Integration:

Extensions can interact with the terminal to provide enhanced functionality. For example, Git extensions can display detailed commit information and allow you to run Git commands directly from the terminal.
Panel Management:

The terminal panel can be moved, resized, and split according to your workflow needs. You can also toggle its visibility quickly when you need more screen real estate for coding.

6. Start Debugging
Click the green play button in the Debug view or press F5 to start debugging. The program will run, and execution will pause at any breakpoints you have set.

Key Debugging Features in VS Code
Breakpoints:

Set breakpoints by clicking on the gutter. Conditional breakpoints can also be set by right-clicking on the breakpoint.
Watch:

Monitor variables and expressions by adding them to the Watch section. Add a watch expression by clicking the + icon in the Watch panel.
Call Stack:

View the call stack to see the sequence of function calls that led to the current point in the execution.
Variables:

Inspect variables in the Variables pane. It shows local and global variables along with their current values.
Debug Console:

Execute commands and evaluate expressions in the Debug Console. It’s useful for testing code snippets and checking variable values.
Step Controls:

Use the controls in the Debug toolbar to:
Continue (F5): Resume program execution.
Step Over (F10): Move to the next line of code, skipping function calls.
Step Into (F11): Step into a function call.
Step Out (Shift + F11): Step out of the current function.
Restart (Ctrl + Shift + F5 / Cmd + Shift + F5): Restart the debugging session.
Stop (Shift + F5): Stop the debugging session.
Inline Values:

During debugging, variable values are shown inline with your code, making it easy to see the values at a glance.

10. Using Source Control:
    - How can users integrate Git with VS Code for version control? Describe the process of initializing a repository, making commits, and pushing changes to GitHub.

    Initializing a Repository
Open your project in VS Code:

Open VS Code and navigate to the folder containing your project using File > Open Folder.
Initialize a Git Repository:

Open the Source Control view by clicking the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar or pressing Ctrl + Shift + G (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Shift + G (macOS).
Click on the Initialize Repository button. This action creates a new Git repository in your project folder.
Configure Git (if not already done):

To stage a file, hover over the file in the list and click the + icon. To stage all changes, click the + icon in the Changes section header.
Write a Commit Message:

After staging the changes, enter a commit message in the input box at the top of the Source Control view.
Commit Changes:

Click the checkmark icon or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows/Linux) or Cmd + Enter (macOS) to commit the changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub
Create a Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository. Do not initialize it with a README, .gitignore, or license, as this will simplify the next steps.
Add GitHub Repository as Remote:

Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/tamtamGF/your-repo.git).
In VS Code, open the terminal and add the remote repository:

Push Changes to GitHub:

Push your commits to the GitHub repository using the terminal:

git push -u origin main
If your branch is not named main, replace main with your branch name.
Additional Git Operations in VS Code
Pulling Changes:

To pull changes from the remote repository, click on the three-dot menu in the Source Control view and select Pull, or use the terminal:


git pull origin main
Branching:

Create a new branch by clicking on the branch name in the bottom left corner and selecting Create new branch.
Switch between branches by clicking the branch name and selecting the desired branch.
Viewing History and Diffs:

View commit history by clicking on the Source Control icon, then the ... menu, and selecting View History.
View file diffs by clicking on a file in the Source Control view to see changes since the last commit.
